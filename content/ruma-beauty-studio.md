This is an interior design project for a private residence located in Saudi Arabia. A big family and servants live in the house. We decided to show you the largest and most atmospheric spaces. We wanted to make a cozy and cool place to relax, to design common and private rooms so that the family would like to spend time together but respect the personal comfort of everyone.

We tried to include the warmness of the landscape into the interior, so there will be no color contrast between outside and inside. The sun rays play perfectly in this living room and create a cozy atmosphere working with the light bobbinets.

Dinning zone consists of the 6 Andreu World chairs and a custom-made granite table. The unique and a little bit hi-tec detail is the steel cabinet. We thought it would be a cool contrast between the natural stone on the wall and brushed steel. By the way we got a beautiful play of sun rays on the facade of this cabinet.
